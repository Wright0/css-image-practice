# css-image-practice

As a side project, I've been learning to make images using purely CSS. Below are the images I've created so far. The code for each are in their own folders.


| Project name      | Description   | Image |
| ----------------- |-------------| -----|
| Bear/Koala Hybrid | Made using [this tutorial](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2). | <img src="https://github.com/Wright0/css-image-practice/blob/master/koala/Koala-bear-hybrid.png" width="450">|
| Bear              | I used the image on the right as a model and aimed to recreate it (minus the scruff). [Image model source](https://dribbble.com/shots/3327325-Bear-Cub-dailycssimages-Day-1)|<img src="https://github.com/Wright0/css-image-practice/blob/master/bear/mybearleft-modelbearright.png" width="350">|
| Pokedex           | Created using images of pokedexes on google image as inspiration. This is part of a project to create a working Pokedex using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) and react. That repository is located [here](https://github.com/Wright0/react-pokedex).|<img src="https://github.com/Wright0/css-image-practice/blob/master/pokedex/Pokedex-gen2.png" width="350"> |
